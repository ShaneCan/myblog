I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Transportation from Inner Mongolia University of Technology in 2017. Following that, I advanced my studies at the Civil Aviation Flight University of China, where I am currently pursuing a Master's degree under the guidance of Prof. Xinping Zhu, with an expected graduation date of July 2024. Currently, my research focus is directed towards the automation of vehicle at airports (GSE) and application of 3D Reconstruction. With a deep-seated passion for the transportation sector, I am particularly interested in leveraging computer vision to address and mitigate traffic safety challenges.
