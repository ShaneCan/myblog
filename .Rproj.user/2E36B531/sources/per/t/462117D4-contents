abstract: As the most stressful area for airport traffic, apron operation safety is getting increasing attention from all walks of life. For the possible wingtip scraping problem in the process of aircraft taxiing into the gate, a conflict determination method for the aircraft gate taxi-in process based on wingtip keypoint detection is designed. The aircraft gate taxi-in conflict detection model with object detection, keypoint detection, coordinate conversion and conflict pre-warning is designed using the apron activity video as the monitoring data source; Combining the needs of aircraft wingtip detection in the apron, the fourth level branch and the fourth stage of the original HRNet are streamlined to obtain the HRNet-lite network to realize the lightweight processing of the network; In view of the shortcomings of the traditional video conflict detection based on the distance determination of imaging pixels, a coordinate conversion algorithm for fixed surveillance cameras is designed to convert the coordinates of imaging pixels to the actual coordinates located on the apron surface to improve the accuracy of conflict determination based on distance determination; Considering the static spacing criteria and dynamic collision avoidance process for aircraft activities in the apron, a method is proposed to delineate the wingtip safety zone containing the early warning zone and the warning zone, and a corresponding conflict detection model is designed for the scraping after the vehicle invades the wingtip safety zone; The physical sandbox of an airport corresponding to the apron is constructed to validate the aircraft wingtip conflict detection model, and the results show that the average F1-Score of model warning is 92.22% and the average F1-Score of early warning is 97.93%. The model is less affected by the changes of aircraft taxi-in speed, aircraft wingspan, and vehicle speed, which has strong robustness. This project can be extended to all kinds of airports to reduce the accident rate in the apron and realize the key guarantee for the safety of apron operation.
