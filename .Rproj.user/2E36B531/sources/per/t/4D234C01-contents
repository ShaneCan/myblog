## Reflection and Outlook on the 2024 Spring Festival

  The Lunar New Year of 2024 is fast approaching. As this day comes to an end, I attempt to write some words for myself. Bidding farewell to the year 2023, we embark on a new chapter in both body and spirit. Looking back at the past year, as we reclaimed our original life and work trajectories, we witnessed unprecedented technological innovations, societal transformations, and developmental challenges in human society. In this era, change is the constant theme, but what remains unchanged is our need to maintain a sense of innovation that resonates with the times, both in perception and action.
  
  Undoubtedly, a new wave of technological revolution characterized by artificial intelligence is entering our lives with unprecedented depth and breadth. We are deeply involved in it, whether we are willing or not. Despite this, human emotional cognition and the capacity for self-awareness and reflection ensure that humanity will remain a significant presence on this planet for a considerable time to come. Discussing human history may seem too grandiose and distant, yet each person develops within the scale of their own life. No matter how advanced life sciences become, we still cannot arbitrarily extend or control the length of life to this day. However, it is entirely possible to increase the breadth and depth of our lives through self-awareness, reflection, and action. In this sense, introspection is often the most important. Regardless of how mighty the currents of the times are, whether we drift with the flow or strive to lead, our value concepts dominate us, and our every small action reflects our value anchors. Throughout our lives, there are things worth perceiving, upholding, and defending. When we encounter problems in life, we should reflect on whether we have considered everything thoroughly. When we face difficulties in learning, we should ask ourselves if we have made enough effort. All such experiences are the best arrangements in disguise, and only with this mindset can we remain calm and composed. Let the justice, kindness, love, and rationality within us be the strong support that steadies our journey, and let simplicity and integrity be the catalysts for the true maturation of our souls.

  In the past year, we have tried to reconnect and repair, aiming in our own direction, maintaining our resolve, and upholding our aspirations in adversity. We persisted in thinking within frameworks and reasoning with logic, building our ability to judge and execute the development of things. Any temporary setbacks in learning and life are merely the prelude to the next success. With continuous effort and perseverance, we can break through the darkness that hinders us, which is greatly beneficial to both ourselves and our nation, as every effort is a call of hope. At the same time, we take group consciousness, team spirit, courage to innovate, and daring to create as our action guides, enhancing our initiative and creativity. In our studies and work, through more communication, more thinking, and multi-level connections, we will surely find the codes for breakthroughs and innovation.

  I will be entering the doctoral phase of my studies in the autumn of 2024, which presents both new opportunities and challenges for me. During my doctoral studies, I will enter a broader platform, learn more cutting-edge knowledge, and commit to more in-depth topics, which excites and thrills me. At the same time, I will face the challenge of integrating into different cultural customs and living habits, as well as the research pressures of the doctoral period alone. But I am confident and capable of handling all this, and I believe this will be a pivotal year in my life's journey. 2024, here I come!
