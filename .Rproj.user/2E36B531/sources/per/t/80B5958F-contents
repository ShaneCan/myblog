abstract: Unmanned operation in airport ground support processes is a major trend in the future devel-opment of civil aviation. In this context, we introduce an innovative perceptual and control method for Autonomous Ground Support Equipment (GSE) within the apron aircraft stand. Firstly, we designed an inventive Virtual Channel Layout within the aircraft stand for Un-manned GSE, considering the operational rules and varying aircraft types. This layout employs turning induction markers to define critical turning points and direct GSE navigation. Secondly, we addressed the necessity for rapid and highly precise pose adjustments during docking by in-tegrating cameras and Lidar sensors. By implementing an enhanced boundary line detection and a lightweight improved YOLO algorithm, this helps to quick and accurate detection of bounda-ries, obstacles, and docking targets. Finally, we developed a unique control algorithm designed to aptly navigate obstacle avoidance and docking for GSE under diverse apron operational sce-narios, ensuring precise control over vehicle pose and speed. Our experimental results indicate a detection accuracy of 89% for the Virtual Channel Boundary Line, 95% for guiding markers, and an F1-Score of 0.845 for the YOLO object detection algorithm. The GSE demonstrated a mean docking error position of less than 3 cm and an angular deviation below 5 degrees. These results substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed methodology for Unmanned GSE navigation and aircraft docking.
