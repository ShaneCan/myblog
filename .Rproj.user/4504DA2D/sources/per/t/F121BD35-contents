abstract: Airport operational safety has been a relatively active area of research. However, the aircraft taxi-in process, which is a high-accident phase, has been less studied. To solve the potential conflicts that may be brought by the engine operation during the aircraft taxiing into the gate, an engine danger areas incursion detection model with object detection, keypoint detection, and conflict warning system is designed using the apron camera video as the monitoring data source. Combining with the needs of engine detection, the original HRNet is streamlined and compared with Lite-HRNet to select the optimal network. Considering the intake hazards, exhaust hazards, engine design parameters, static spacing criteria, and dynamic collision avoidance process, refined engine danger areas to establish an incursion detection model. An apron physical sandbox corresponding to an airport is applied for validation, the results show that the model has strong accuracy and real-time performance.
