## A Life lesson from my supervisor

  Human life is very short, time will not wait for us, it will only forget us. The past three years of the epidemic, the past ten years, the past twenty years ......, the dead are like this. The life of a human being is short, and it is as small as a corn in the long river of human history. However, it is a very worthwhile thing to do every time at the interface of the intersection of history, to know the era we live in in the big historical coordinates, and to increase our understanding of life, life and family sentiment.

  Our generation is fortunate that we have spanned a century, and even more so a millennium. Looking back, we have also experienced so much in the first 20 years of the new century. What follows has been and will remain an era of heightened uncertainty. Although there have been many ups and downs, in the spatial and temporal coordinates of history, on a world scale, in the 1620s, 1720s, 1820s, 1920s, successive industrial revolutions or wars, human society has spiraled upward, creating social elites or mainstream nations of different eras. From the Chinese perspective, the country was in a period of warlord chaos in the 1920s; a century further back, in the 1820s, China was in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, and after a brief period of inspirational rule, the humiliating modern history was about to begin. The torrent of the times is vast, and each individual who is wrapped in it, whether to go with the flow or to fight for the flow, is worthy of consideration by each one of us.

  In the change to seek a new situation, do a good top-level planning, anchor the direction of development, not only for the country and society, also applies to individuals. In an era of uncertainty, the only way to be transparent and sober is to look at everything in the world with a macro and super-dimensional vision, and to build up our ability to think in terms of framework and reason with logic. The aim is to pay attention to new technologies in the industry and to always be curious and enterprising. At the same time, we should build up our own spiritual land and home while we join the flood of social development, practice scientific and technological changes, and accumulate knowledge and skills, so that each of us can be a complete and rich individual and not be confused, overwhelmed or even lose ourselves in the complicated world. This is an era of flight and uncertainty, but the only thing that is certain and that we can choose and control is that we can work hard to accumulate knowledge and talents and to build our own spiritual home.
