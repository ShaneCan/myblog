abstract: The integration of unmanned guidance vehicles is posited to effectively mitigate the safety hazards associated with human-piloted guidance, such as aircraft misguidance and omission. However, current research on the risks associated with unmanned guidance vehicles during the implementation of aircraft taxiing guidance is neither comprehensive nor quantitatively established. This paper presents a simulation of unmanned guidance vehicles implementing human-piloted aircraft taxiing, utilizing a coordinate transformation algorithm to interconnect data across dual platforms. By applying Monte Carlo simulation, a dataset representative of the entire taxiing guidance process is generated. Focusing on the movement between unmanned guidance vehicles and human-piloted aircraft during taxiing, three primary risk assessment indicators are introduced. A risk evaluation index weight normalization function is employed, based on a Gaussian distribution that conforms to a normal distribution, to qualitatively assess risk levels according to quantifiable operational data. The findings indicate that quantifiable risk assessment indicators can provide more timely and referenceable risk evaluations, offering actionable solutions for risk mitigation.
